# Weezer Programming Language or WPL
## _The programming language for weezer fans_


WPL is an esoteric programming language that behaves like BASIC but has syntax inspired by weezer lyrics. 

- Incredibly easy due to its BASIC inspired code
- Uses weezer lyrics in syntax to make coding easier
- ✨all code is split and organized by albums✨

## Examples of the Language
Hello World in WPL is easy

```
ALBUM BLUE;
  SAY IT AINT SO <<"HELLO WORLD">>;
THANK YOU AND GOOD NIGHT;
```
Fibonacci? Peice of cake.

```
ALBUM BLUE;
  MY NAME IS <<NUMBER>>. IM CARRYING THE <<0>>;
  SAY IT AINT SO <<"NUMBER OF TERMS:">>;
  GETCHOO <<NUMBER>>;
  NUMBERS ARE OUT TO GET YOU, <<NUMBER>>;
  IF YOU WANT << NUMBER==0 >> THEN YOU CAN HAVE <<END>>;
  MY NAME IS <<N1>>. IM CARRYING THE <<0>>;
  MY NAME IS <<N2>>. IM CARRYING THE <<1>>;
  MY NAME IS <<NEXTTERM>>. IM CARRYING THE <<0>>;
  SAY IT AINT SO <<"FIBONACCI SERIES:">>;
  MY NAME IS <<I>>. IM CARRYING THE <<1>>;
  IV GOT << I<NUMBER >> IN MY HEAD SPINNING OUT OF CONTROL;
    SAY IT AINT SO <<N1>>;
    AND <<NEXTTERM>> LOOKS JUST LIKE <<N1 + N2>>;
    AND <<N1>> LOOKS JUST LIKE <<N2>>;
    AND <<N2>> LOOKS JUST LIKE <<NEXTTERM>>;
    AND <<I>> LOOKS JUST LIKE <<I + 1>>;
  THEY GO ROUND AND AROUND AND AGAIN;
THANK YOU AND GOOD NIGHT;
```

## Try WPL out

Want to try out WPL? Install python and try the code out. All code in main.wzr will be ran by main.py. An installer and executable for WPL is coming soon.

## Why?
I made this so that anyone can code with a weezer themed programming language while listening to their favorite weezer songs. Other programming languages such as python don't come close to the level of productivity that this language has at its full potential. I am working on this language adding more and more features so that it can be less esoteric and more fun to use.
